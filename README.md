# SCT_DS_2
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# PROJECT: DATA CLEANING & EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)
# DATASET: TITANIC DATASET (FROM KAGGLE)
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Import Required Libraries
# - pandas: for data manipulation
# - numpy: for numerical operations
# - matplotlib & seaborn: for data visualization
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# 2. Load the Dataset
# - Read the CSV file using pandas
# - Display first few rows to understand the structure
# - Check the shape of the dataset (rows, columns)
# 3. Inspect the Data
# - Use df.info() to view data types and non-null counts
# - Use df.describe() for basic statistical summary
# - Identify categorical and numerical features
# 4. Check for Missing Values
# - Use df.isnull().sum() to count missing values per column
# - Decide how to handle missing data:
# * Drop columns/rows with too many missing values
# * Fill missing numerical values with mean or median
# * Fill missing categorical values with mode (most frequent value)
# 5. Data Cleaning
# - Handle missing values appropriately (e.g., fill or drop)
# - Convert data types if necessary (e.g., object to category)
# - Remove duplicates if any using df.drop_duplicates()
# - Rename columns for consistency and clarity
# - Handle outliers if they affect the analysis
#  - Handle outliers if they affect the analysis
# 6. Univariate Analysis (Single Variable)
# - Analyze one feature at a time
# - For numerical columns:
# * Plot histograms and boxplots to check distributions
# - For categorical columns:
# * Use countplots or pie charts to view frequency of categories
# 7. Bivariate Analysis (Two Variables)
# - Explore relationships between independent and dependent variables
# - Examples:
# * Survival vs Gender (sns.countplot)
# * Survival vs Passenger Class
# * Age vs Survival (using boxplot)
# - Observe how variables affect the target (Survived)
# 8. Multivariate Analysis (More than Two Variables)
# - Use grouped plots or pairplots to explore combined effects
# - Example: Survival rate by Gender and Class together
# - Helps identify patterns and complex relationships
# 9. Correlation Analysis
# - Use df.corr() to compute correlation between numeric columns
# - Plot a heatmap using seaborn to visualize correlations
# - Identify which variables have strong or weak relationships
# 10. Identify Patterns and Trends
# - Women and children had higher survival rates
# - Passengers in higher classes (Pclass 1) survived more often
# - Younger passengers were more likely to survive
# - Fare tends to be higher for survivors (indicating class/facility difference)
# 11. Data Visualization
# - Use histograms, bar plots, box plots, and heatmaps to represent insights
# - Customize charts with titles, labels, and colors for clarity
# 12. Summary of Findings
# - Summarize key observations and insights found during EDA
# - Mention any assumptions, patterns, or anomalies detected
# - Prepare the cleaned dataset for further modeling (if needed)
